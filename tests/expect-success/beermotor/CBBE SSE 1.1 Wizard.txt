MOD_Readme = str("CBBE replaces the vanilla female body that all adult female characters \(player and NPC\) share, with one that is fully customisable with the BodySlide tool. By default there are three nude options available that don\'t require anything but installation\, as well as two underwear styles for these body shapes.\n\nAlso included are all vanilla and DLC outfits converted to the base three body shapes, with additional BodySlide compatibility including sliders and many zaps.\n\nThe body mesh is completely custom and has 13554 vertices\, which is more than 20 times the resolution of the vanilla Skyrim body and 6 times that of the older CBBE.\n Included are textures made from photographs of real women\, and multiple choices of high-res normal map to fit the body shape you want. Also redone are the mesh weights for animation\, offering improved deformation in many poses.\n\nNote to modders: If you wish to create armour\/clothes for the bodies\, make use of the conversion references coming with BodySlide in Outfit Studio \(the base shape of CBBE\, otherwise the \"Outfit\" presets\) or your preferred modelling software. Ideally\, create BodySlide projects so that your outfits will fit regardless of shape preset.")
