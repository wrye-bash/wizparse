MM_Readme = str("Majestic Mountains v 1.57 22/07/2017\n\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n--------------------\n-It is very uncommon in a readme\. But this mod is gaining complexity.\n1. Snow\n1.1 Improved Snow\n\nGENERAL USAGE NOTES\n--------------------\n\n- Majestic Mountains 1\.56 suggests using Improved Snow\.\nIf you are using Dolomite Weathers use Dolomite Weathers fix\. I\'ve tested the fix and it looks good in various lighting situations and can be used in ENBs that have too bright snow at night too\. You may sometimes have only barely visible sparkles at night but I choose the snw SSS settings for fitting\. Other settings create ugly visible seems between objects that have snow textures and the landscape snow\. The problem is that the snow shader isn\'t applied to objects although they have a snow texture\. The whole object has to be marked with \"considered snow\" then\.\n\n- You can always adjust the snow settings to fit your needs in the MajesticMountains\.ini in Skyrim\'s data folder\: You can find your favorite settings ingame with the command\:\nsetini \"fSnowSSSColorR\:display\" \(your number\) for example\.\nsetini \"fSnowSSSColor\:Gdisplay\" \(your number\) for example\.\nsetini \"fSnowSSSColorB\:display\" \(your number\) for example\.\n\nThe tint depends on the relations between the values of r\,g and b.\\nOnce you\'ve found your favorite setting simply write the values in the ini then\.\n\n- The snow in this mod is designed for working with the projecteddiffuse texture\. This texture is usally loaded if the Snow Shader is enabled in the launcher and will be skipped when it is disabled\. If you want to play without Improved Snow you need to set \"bEnableProjecteUVDiffuseNormals\" in your SkyrimPrefs\.ini to 1\. Custom inis don\'t work with SkyrimPref\.ini settings unfortunatly\.\n\n-All landscape and snow textures are put in a compmentary texture pack for better compatibility\. This helps users who use different textures because there are no conflicts while installing anymore\. This pack will be expanded in the future and finally seperated as a stand alone mod\.\n\n- Majestic Mountains v 1\.41 and up will be as modular as possible to improve compatibility and to allow users adjusting it to fit their needs\.\n\n- The moss was put into a seperate esp\. This gives the user the choice to play without it\.\n\n- The sun direction was transfered into seperate esp files\. You have the choice between the game default sun direction by disabling\n\"SunDaytimeNorth_MM_default\" and \"SunDaytimeSouth\.esp\"\.\n\"SunDaytimeNorth_MM_default\" contains the Majestic Mountains default setting while \"SunDaytimeSouth\.esp\" is naturally correct way of the sun during day\. You should only have one of them active\. I\'m planning an installer for future versions to prevent searching the modlist for the esp files\.\n\n CAUTION\:\nSun direction MAY cause conflicts with future versions of ENB\.\nIf you run into a 95 percent daytime issue you need to disable sun direction esp\`s\.\n\n- Make sure that MajesticMountains\.esp is on top of the other parts of the mod.\n\n- The load order of the other parts doesn\'t matter\. They don\'t conflict with each other\.\n\n- The base mod doesn\'t contain alternate textures or compatibility patches\.\nReason 1\:\nYou have a better control of these optional files as seperate mod\. Because they don\'t contain esp\'s.\ You\'ll have to fiddle around in the file structure for swapping or replacing\.\nReason 2\:\nNot everyone uses SMIM for example. Providing these files automatically may collide with the ethical rules of the Nexus.\n\n- Unused esp files can be safely deleted. It is also possible to merge the plugins because they don\'t conflict with each other\.Except the DaytimeNorth conflicts with the DaytimeSouth\.\n\n\nINSTALLATION\n-----------------\n\n- I would highly recommend you to use the Nexus Mod Manager for installation\. NMM makes it easier to swap textures\.\nIf you try out alternate textures and you want to go back to the default texture set all you have to do is disabling the mod of the alternate texture\. NMM should restore the default texture set of Majestic Mountains\. If not\! Simply right klick at the main mod and choose reinstall\.\n\n\nTROUBLESHOOTING\n-----------------------\n\n-Report issues in the comment section or via pm please\.\nI\'ll try to help as fast as possible\. And if I can\'t solve the issue there were many helpful members active in the comment section\.\nI will abuse this line to say\: Thank you very much\.\n\n\nPERMISSIONS\n---------------\n\n- You may change the files and use them into your own mod with following conditions\:\n\n-You change a larger amount of files. Creating a simple texture pack doesn\'t need to have the meshes included\.\n-You want to create a compatibility patch\.\n-You are creating a larger mod like Falskaar and you want to include Parts of Majestic Mountains.\n-You may upload this mod without changes if you give me full credit and link to the main mod\.\n- You don't need to contact me first. A simple credit is enough honor for me\.")
